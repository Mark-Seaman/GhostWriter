# Software Project Milestones

### Application Project

Throughout this course you will build a medium sized application with the following guidelines

* Patterned after a popular web-based application
* Build software with a team of four people
* Deliver code on a fixed schedule with 7 milestones
* Each milestone every member will be assigned a unique role (requirements, design, code, test) that rotates 

### Milestone 1: Project Charter

In this milestone, the team will work together to identify the requirements of the app. The outcome
of this milestone will be a detailed requirements document that outlines the scope, features, and
functionality of the app. We will work with stakeholders to gather and analyze requirements for the
web-based software app. We will create a detailed requirements document that outlines the scope,
features, and functionality of the app.

### Milestone 2: Software Design and Architecture

In this milestone, we will design the architecture and user interface of the web-based software app.
We will create a detailed software design document that outlines the high-level architecture of the
app, the user interface design, and the technology stack that will be used. This milestone will 
include an early version of the application hosting.

### Milestone 3: Implementation and Coding

In this milestone, the team will work together to write the code for the app. We will develop a
functional prototype of the web-based software app. We will use an agile development approach and
build the minimum viable product (MVP) that includes the core features and functionality. The
outcome of this milestone will be a fully functional app with all the core features and
functionality implemented.

### Milestone 4: Testing and Quality Assurance

In this milestone, we will test the web-based software app and ensure that it meets the requirements
specified in the requirements document. We will use automated testing tools and manual testing to
verify that the app works as expected. We will identify and fix any defects or issues that arise
during testing.  50% of all code written must be test code. Code coverage should be over 95%

### Milestone 5: Deployment and Release Management

In this milestone, we will integrate the web-based software app with any third-party services or
APIs and deploy it to a production environment. We will use continuous integration and deployment
tools to automate the deployment process and ensure that the app is available to users. 
The outcome of this milestone will be a live app that is available to users.

### Milestone 6: User Feedback and Enhancement

In this milestone, we will gather feedback from users and identify areas for improvement. We will
use this feedback to enhance the web-based software app and release updates and improvements as
needed. We will also monitor the performance and usage of the app to identify any issues or areas
for improvement. The outcome of this milestone will be updates and improvements to the app based on
user feedback.

### Milestone 7: Project Closeout

In this milestone, we will conduct a project review and analyze the project performance. We will
document any lessons learned and prepare a final report. We will celebrate our successes and
identify areas for improvement for future projects.


## Development Roles

Throughout this project students will perform a unique role: requirements, design, code, test.  
Each milestone every member will be assigned a set of tasks to complete. The roles will rotate
with each milestone exposing every student to every mindset that required of engineers.

Specific outcomes will be delivered by each student.  Assignments will be at the beginning of each
milestone so that everyone can work toward the expected result. Each milestone will end by
assessing the work for every team member.
