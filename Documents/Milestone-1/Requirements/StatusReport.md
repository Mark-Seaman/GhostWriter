## What I did for Milestone 1

1. Requirement Gathering: 

The requirements of the Ghost Writer applications were defined by the needs of potential authors
that need support in the overall process of writing.  The results of the  Requirement Gathering
are documented in the [Ghost Writer - Product Features](GhostWriter-ProductFeatures.md).


2. Prioritization and Scope Definition: 

The product features support goals of writers who want guidance during development and instant
publishing of the result. The project scope and priorities and feature set are all documented
in the [Ghost Writer - Product Features](GhostWriter-ProductFeatures.md).


3. Stakeholder Review and Approval: 

Since this project has started I have been reviewing the features and  project plans with
people that would be potential customers for this project.  I plan on continuing this 
review process and intend to allow feedback to influence the development throughout the
entire project.

I also intend to produce a video at every stage of the development to explain how the
system works.  This may spark some additional feedback and renewed interest in the project.


4. Milestone Review: 

Because this project is not being done to satisfy external stakeholders there is no formal
milestone review meeting or presentation.  On a more typical project this is important
for a comprehensive assessment of the completed tasks, progress, and stakeholder satisfaction. 
It provides an opportunity to address any potential issues or gaps before moving forward, 
ensuring that the project remains on track and that everyone is aligned on the initial requirements.


5. Status Video 

I created a summary of the requirements work completed.  View the video at 
[Milestone 1 - Requirements](Video.md)


## What I will do for Milestone 2

Plan out 3 phases of implmentation (core features, full features, bonus features).

Build customer/stakeholder communication

Create team project communication and planning

Update product requirements


## Concerns and Challenges

I am not quite sure about how integrate ChatGPT into Ghost Writer.
