# Software Application Team Project

## Application Project

Welcome to the Software Application Team Project! This project aims to provide you with hands-on experience in software engineering while working in a team environment. Throughout the course, you will be building a medium-sized application, patterned after a popular web-based application, with a team of four people. The project will be divided into seven milestones, with each milestone focusing on a different aspect of the application development process.

Throughout this course you will build a medium sized application with the following guidelines

* Patterned after a popular web-based application
* Build software with a team of four people
* Deliver code on a fixed schedule with 7 milestones
* Each milestone every member will be assigned a unique role (requirements, design, code, test) that rotates 


## Goals

The primary goal of this project is for you to learn software engineering by actually doing software engineering. This means that you will be applying the theories and concepts learned in class to build a real-world application. By the end of the project, you should have a good understanding of the software development life cycle and be able to collaborate effectively in a team setting.

Additionally, you will have the opportunity to build a medium-sized app from start to finish with a team of four people. This will give you a taste of what it's like to work on a software development project in the real world. You will learn how to collaborate, delegate tasks, and make decisions as a team.


## Application Teams

You will be assigned to an application team.  If you would like to request to work on a specific application then let me know and I will try to accomodate your wishes.
