# Learn By Doing

## Experience is Gained through Practice

When it comes to learning about software engineering, there is no substitute for hands-on
experience. While reading books and listening to lectures can provide a foundation of knowledge, it
is through actively engaging with software projects that true mastery is achieved. Experience is
the catalyst that allows individuals to see and navigate through a multitude of different
situations, ultimately leading to growth and improvement.

One of the fundamental principles of software engineering is the importance of practical
application. This means that simply acquiring theoretical knowledge is not sufficient in this
field. Software engineering demands the application of concepts in practical scenarios. It is
through working on real-life projects that individuals gain the skills and expertise necessary to
succeed in this field.

Experience is a powerful teacher. As individuals engage in more projects and gradually accumulate
hands-on experience, their productivity tends to grow. This growth is usually rapid at the
beginning and becomes more gradual over time. The reason for this is that with increased
experience, the learning curve becomes less steep. Initially, individuals must learn and adapt to
new concepts and techniques, which requires a significant investment of time and effort. However,
as they become more familiar with various programming languages, frameworks, and software
development practices, their learning requirements decrease, leading to increased productivity.


## Course Organization

In line with the philosophy of "learn by doing," our software engineering class will provide a
realistic environment for students to develop their skills. Instead of following traditional
lecture-based teaching methods or conducting exams, the focus will be on actively participating in
the creation of a commercial software application. Each student will be a part of a team, working
together to build a functioning software product.

To ensure a comprehensive learning experience, every individual will be assigned specific tasks and
responsibilities that aim to teach engineering practices. As a mentor, my role will be to guide
students in their journey and provide support whenever needed. Additionally, I will assume the role
of a business manager, helping students understand the commercial aspects of software development
and the importance of meeting client requirements.


## Simulated Business Environment

Speaking of clients, I will also act as the client in this learning environment. This means that
students will have the opportunity to experience the dynamics of working directly with a client and
understanding their needs and expectations. By assuming multiple roles, students will gain a
holistic understanding of the entire software engineering process, from conceptualization to
delivery, and the importance of effective communication and collaboration.

My Role will be as:

* **Mentor** to help you when you get stuck
* **Business** Manager to set the business goals
* **Client** to express needs and give feedback on your work
* **Guide** to help you navigate the world of software engineering

In this class you will gain experience that will be directly relevant to any development that
you do later. By embracing a "learn by doing" approach, our class aims to foster a realistic
learning environment where students can thrive and become successful software engineers. So let's
roll up our sleeves and embark on this exciting journey together.
