### Describe your project scope

#### Development Criteria for Milestone 1: Project Charter
Milestone 1 of a software development project is crucial as it lays the foundation for the entire project. To successfully pass this milestone, there are 16 key development criteria that need to be met. These criteria are divided among the roles of the project manager, designer, programmer, and QA engineer.

#### Project Manager Responsibilities
* Define project goals and objectives: The project manager must clearly articulate the purpose and desired outcomes of the project.
* Define project scope and deliverables: The project manager needs to establish the boundaries and specific deliverables of the project.
* Identify project stakeholders: Identifying all stakeholders involved in the project is essential for effective communication and collaboration.
* Develop project timeline and budget: The project manager should create a timeline that outlines the project's milestones and a budget that outlines the estimated costs.

### Lead the team
* Meet with the team and discuss how to define the project scope, the selection of the
technology and hosting to be done and how to use version control.
* Setup a standard place to document your team meetings.  Hold a weekly team meeting to have
each person document what they did, what they plan to do, and what challenges they face.  
Track the engineering time spent by each team member and add it to the document. Keep
this meeting short, but document the results.
* Record a five-minute video to document and demonstrate the work you did.

### Setup your Github repo with links
* Use the Github repo that was created by the coder.
* Write a short document to set expectations for what each team member will create.
* Publish you video, meeting notes, and project charter at the required URLs.  Test these
URLs with the self [test page](selftest) provided.
