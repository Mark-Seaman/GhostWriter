# Deliverables - Milestone 1: Project Charter

Milestone 1 of a software development project is crucial as it lays the foundation for the entire project. To successfully pass this milestone, there are key development criteria that need to be met. These criteria are divided among the roles of the project manager, designer, programmer, and QA engineer.

By meeting these development criteria, a team can successfully pass Milestone 1. Each role has its unique responsibilities, and effective collaboration and communication among team members are vital for achieving the desired outcomes of the milestone.

Remember, Milestone 1 lays the groundwork for the entire project, setting the stage for success as the team progresses further.
