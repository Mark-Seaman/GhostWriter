## 4 Keys to Effective AI

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly important in the world of business. Companies
are using it to streamline processes, improve customer experience, and gain a competitive edge.
However, implementing AI can be a daunting task. To help you get started, I've put together four
keys areas to consider as you begin using AI.

Thinking through each of these aspects will get you off on the right foot and make you far more
effective.  Your overall goal should be to use the AI to augment your key task that you are doing
today.  Don't view Chat-GPT as a way to automate your job but rather as a "force multiplier" for
your own efforts.


## Develop your strategy

Before diving into AI, it's important to have a strategy in place. Determine what you want to
achieve with AI and what resources you'll need to make it happen. Consider the potential risks and
benefits and create a plan to mitigate any potential drawbacks.

My professional life involves many different types of tasks including: learning, teaching,
researching, writing, programming.  Each of these can be radically transform by having access to
Chat-GPT and potentially other AI tools. But it requires some special thought to figure out how the
tools are best applied.  The goal is to look at each of these jobs and see how you can prompt the
AI agent to produce the results you need.


## Develop your prompt library

Your prompt library is a collection of pre-written messages or queries that your AI tool will use to
respond to user requests. Creating a comprehensive prompt library will ensure that your AI system
is able to handle a wide range of scenarios and deliver accurate responses.

Imagine that you have an AI agent trapped inside a server that has memorized the entire internet. If
it is on the internet then the agent knows about it.  However, you must get this agent to talk to
you and tell you what it knows.

These prompt get your agent talking and thinking about a subject. "Tell me why Albert Einstein was
interested in General Relativity." or "Recommend a good spy thriller. Give me 10 choices."  These
prompts can be stored and reused later in similar situations.


## Develop your workflow

There is an art to learning how to construct the AI prompts that you use.  You will want to store
these in a text file so that you can easily recall the phrases that you find most useful.  As you
gain experience with prompt engineering, you will set up a way of working with the AI to produce
the desired content.

This will involve having three windows open so that you can cut-and-paste text between them. The
prompt library gives you a collection of prompts, which can be pasted into the Chat-GPT window.
Then Chat-GPT will answer your prompt and you can cut-and-paste to results into the document that
is being created.

A simple workflow can be as simple as that. Prompts and the document being composed in a text editor
and Chat-GPT running in a browser window.  You can get more fancy later.


## Develop your own personal style

Chat-GPT has a lot of intelligence about how it creates its output.  Here are some examples:

* Place output in an HTML code block
* Create an outline with three levels and use 4 spaces for indent
* Write a summary of "Tale of Two Cities"
* Create a course plan for "Software Engineering"

Coaxing Chat-GPT into producing the right kind of output and getting it into the correct format is a
bit of an art form.

By following these four keys to effective AI, you can ensure that your AI system delivers the
results you need to achieve your business goals. Remember to start with a clear strategy, invest
time and effort into developing your prompt library and workflow, and establish a style guide to
produce effective results immediately. With these tools in place, you'll be well on your way to
mastering the power of AI.
