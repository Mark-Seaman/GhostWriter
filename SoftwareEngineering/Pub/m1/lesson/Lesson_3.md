# Software Development Milestones

The development proceed through a series of milestones.  At each checkpoint a number of criteria
must be met in order for development to continue.


* Milestone 1: **Requirements Gathering and Analysis** -
In this milestone, we will work with stakeholders to gather and analyze requirements for the
web-based software app. We will create a detailed requirements document that outlines the scope,
features, and functionality of the app.

* Milestone 2: **Software Design and Architecture** - 
In this milestone, we will design the architecture and user interface of the web-based software app.
We will create a detailed software design document that outlines the high-level architecture of the
app, the user interface design, and the technology stack that will be used.

* Milestone 3: **Prototype Development** -
In this milestone, we will develop a functional prototype of the web-based software app. We will use
an agile development approach and build the minimum viable product (MVP) that includes the core
features and functionality.

* Milestone 4: **Testing and Quality Assurance** -
In this milestone, we will test the web-based software app and ensure that it meets the requirements
specified in the requirements document. We will use automated testing tools and manual testing to
verify that the app works as expected. We will identify and fix any defects or issues that arise
during testing.

* Milestone 5: **Integration and Deployment** -
In this milestone, we will integrate the web-based software app with any third-party services or
APIs and deploy it to a production environment. We will use continuous integration and deployment
tools to automate the deployment process and ensure that the app is available to users.

* Milestone 6: **User Feedback and Enhancement** -
In this milestone, we will gather feedback from users and identify areas for improvement. We will
use this feedback to enhance the web-based software app and release updates and improvements as
needed. We will also monitor the performance and usage of the app to identify any issues or areas
for improvement.

* Milestone 7: **Project Release** -
In this milestone, we will conduct a project review and analyze the project performance. We will
document any lessons learned and prepare a final report. We will celebrate our successes and
identify areas for improvement for future projects.


## Development Roles

Each role has its own set of responsibilities and contributes to different stages of the project. In
this article, we will explore the general responsibilities of individuals in the roles of
Requirements, Design, Code, and Test, and how they work together to deliver a successful product.

* **Requirements** - manage the project objectives and scope
* **Design** - use technology to produce the desired solution
* **Code** - create the software implmentation of the desired solution
* **Test** - verify that the solution is works properly


## Planning Grid

The seven milestones are combined with the four development roles to produce the plan for 
the overall project.  Each milestone is executed sequentially while maintaining the focus
on all aspects of the development.

Each cell in the planning grid has a specific objective that must be achieved.
Each team will use this process for executing the task required for each milestone.
This technique can be used on any project to guarantee that the work is done at
a steady pace throughout the project.   There will be no Death March at the end
of the project.
