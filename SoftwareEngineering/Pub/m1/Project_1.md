# Software Application Team Project

## Application Project

Welcome to the Software Application Team Project! This project aims to provide you with hands-on experience in software engineering while working in a team environment. Throughout the course, you will be building a medium-sized application, patterned after a popular web-based application, with a team of four people. The project will be divided into seven milestones, with each milestone focusing on a different aspect of the application development process.

Throughout this course you will build a medium sized application with the following guidelines

* Patterned after a popular web-based application
* Build software with a team of four people
* Deliver code on a fixed schedule with 7 milestones
* Each milestone every member will be assigned a unique role (requirements, design, code, test) that rotates 

I hope you are excited about this Software Application Team Project! This project will give you the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in software engineering and work on a medium-sized application with a team of four people. Remember to adhere to the project guidelines and deliver your work on schedule. Good luck and enjoy the learning journey!


## Goals

The primary goal of this project is for you to learn software engineering by actually doing software engineering. This means that you will be applying the theories and concepts learned in class to build a real-world application. By the end of the project, you should have a good understanding of the software development life cycle and be able to collaborate effectively in a team setting.

Additionally, you will have the opportunity to build a medium-sized app from start to finish with a team of four people. This will give you a taste of what it's like to work on a software development project in the real world. You will learn how to collaborate, delegate tasks, and make decisions as a team.


## Project Guidelines

1. **Application Design**: Your application should be patterned after a popular web-based application. This means that you should analyze existing web applications and identify the features and design patterns that make them successful. Use this analysis as a guide when designing your own application.

2. **Team Composition**: The project will be carried out in teams of four people. Each team member will have a specific role assigned to them for each milestone. These roles include requirements, design, code, and test. The roles will rotate with each milestone, ensuring that every team member gets hands-on experience in each aspect of the software development process.

3. **Milestone Deliverables**: There will be seven milestones throughout the course, with one milestone every two weeks. Each milestone will have specific deliverables that need to be completed by each team member based on their assigned role. It is important that you adhere to the fixed schedule and submit your work on time.

4. **Responsibilities Rotation**: As mentioned earlier, the responsibilities will rotate with each milestone. This means that each team member will have the opportunity to take on different roles throughout the project. This rotation is designed to help you gain a comprehensive understanding of the entire software development process and develop a well-rounded skill set.

## Selecting Your Project

Here are eight project ideas patterned after popular web-based apps:

* Project 1: A social media platform patterned after Instagram, called "InstaSnap". InstaSnap allows
  users to post photos and videos, follow other users, and view their content in a chronological
  feed. Users can also like, comment, and share content, and search for content based on hashtags.

* Project 2: An e-commerce platform patterned after Amazon, called "ShopZone". ShopZone allows users
  to browse and purchase products from various sellers, add items to their cart, and complete the
  checkout process. Users can also leave reviews and ratings for products, and search for products
  based on keywords.

* Project 3: A communication platform patterned after Slack, called "TeamTalk". TeamTalk allows
  users to send messages and files to each other in channels or direct messages. Users can also
  create and join teams, and customize notifications and settings.

* Project 4: A video sharing platform patterned after YouTube, called "ViewTube". ViewTube allows
  users to upload and watch videos, subscribe to channels, and view their content in a
  chronological feed. Users can also like, comment, and share videos, and search for videos based
  on keywords.

* Project 5: A project management platform patterned after Trello, called "TaskBoard". TaskBoard
  allows users to create and manage tasks on boards, add labels and deadlines, and assign tasks to
  team members. Users can also customize notifications and settings, and view their tasks in a
  calendar view.

* Project 6: A travel booking platform patterned after Airbnb, called "StayBook". StayBook allows
  users to search and book accommodations, including apartments, houses, and hotels, in various
  locations. Users can also leave reviews and ratings for accommodations, and view photos and
  amenities.

* Project 7: A music streaming platform patterned after Spotify, called "StreamTunes". StreamTunes
  allows users to search and stream music, create and share playlists, and view their listening
  history. Users can also like and follow artists, and customize their preferences.

* Project 8: A professional networking platform patterned after LinkedIn, called "ConnectPro".
  ConnectPro allows users to create and manage a professional profile, search and apply for jobs,
  and network with other professionals. Users can also follow companies and industry leaders, and
  view job recommendations based on their profile.

By building these projects, teams can gain experience in software engineering by working on a
variety of web-based applications, each with their own unique features and functionality.


## Software Project Milestones

We will be working with seven milestones, each of which are a step toward the completed application.

* **Milestone 1**: Requirements Gathering and Analysis
* **Milestone 2**: Software Design and Architecture
* **Milestone 3**: Implementation and Coding
* **Milestone 4**: Testing and Quality Assurance
* **Milestone 5**: Deployment and Release Management
* **Milestone 6**: User Feedback and Enhancement
* **Milestone 7**: Project Closeout


## Development Roles

Throughout this project students will perform a unique role: requirements, design, code, test.  
Each milestone every member will be assigned a set of tasks to complete. The roles will rotate
with each milestone exposing every student to every mindset that required of engineers.

Specific outcomes will be delivered by each student.  Assignments will be at the beginning of each
milestone so that everyone can work toward the expected result. Each milestone will end by
assessing the work for every team member.


## Assignment Details

For this project, your team will be building a medium-sized application with the goal of learning software engineering and gaining hands-on experience. The application should be patterned after a popular web-based application, which will serve as a guide for your design and implementation.

There will be specific assignments for each milestone and each development role:

Please note that these assignments will rotate with each milestone, meaning that each team member will have the opportunity to take on different roles throughout the project.
